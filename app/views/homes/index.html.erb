<p class="large"> After a long career as a hardware technician, then another equally long career building
    applications with Microsoft technology,
    OneOriginalGeek has spent the past seven years building websites on a contract basis, using
    PHP for a couple of years and then switching over to Ruby on Rails in 2005. </p>

<p class="large">This site is published by a coder with lots of experiences (both good and bad).
  You can check out some of my experiences if you check out the blog, &nbsp; <a href="http://blog.oneoriginalgeek.com"> Ramblings on Rails</a> -
  all about my experiences with contract Rails application development.
