<p> After a long career building applications with Microsoft technology,
    OneOriginalGeek has been building websites over the past seven years.
    I used PHP for a couple of years and then found Ruby on Rails and never looked back. </p>

<p>This site is published by a coder with lots of experiences (both good and bad).
  You can check out some of my experiences as you check out the blog, <a href="http://blog.oneoriginalgeek.com"> Ramblings on Rails</a> - all about our experiences with contract Rails application development.
